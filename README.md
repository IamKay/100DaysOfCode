# 100DaysOfCode

This is my second attempt at this challenge. Last time, i did not know the "documentation" rule, so it didn't count.

* Day 1

  > Started with **React** apps making process. Made a very basic Todo app [here](https://github.com/kayd33/Todo/tree/master/todo-1)
  
* Day 2
  > Started learning about Polymer from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaWcS-10NIw&list=PLLnpHn493BHHbOWwQxtGCVfEgWZxxofyA) and the official [page](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/start/)

* Day 3
  > Continued with reading on polymer. Today i tried a hands-on practice rather than just reading. I tried making a couple of simple elements, fixed some problems with importing elements. Hopefully there will be something worth posting on github as well.

* Day 4
  > Began making a polymer carousel element by following and understanding the codelab. I'm following the polymer 2 codelab in  Poylmer 3. It took the whole day and now i'm stuck at the second last step. I even opened an issue and i'll try to fix it myself tomorrow.

* Day 5
  > Opened an issue and got the solution for the error. Not the element works. Meanwhile i began learning about PWAs. I'm thinking of starting a Udemy course on that. Will provide more info on that in later days. Now i added touch events as the final step of codelab. Will test it on an actual mobile tomorrow.

  > UPDATE: Tested in the mobile simulator of Chrome. It works just fine.

* Day 6
  > Began developing a new js app. Will make a repo soon (most probably tomorrow). Also, finished the *getting to know the course* section of the PWA course. Didn't get time to do more. Also, i had to learn the basics of webpack to get the app running. One more thing, Polymer 3 community is so not good at this time. There is nothing else except the official docs for help. Hope that changes soon.

* Day 7
  > Made the repo [here](https://github.com/kayd33/TextToEmoji). Still working on it. The processing is a bit tricky because the number of combinations to consider is high. Hoperfully till mid next week i'll work it out completely. 

* Day 8
  > Worked out the logic sooner than i thought. It is now working, pushed a styles commit too. It looks a acceptable now. I do have a few things left in this app. Will do that tommorow.

* Day 9
  > Completed the app. The working app is [here](https://kayd33.github.io/TextToEmoji). Working out the last bit was not easy. I was dealing with MDL library and had to make it shorter. Didn't really compare the timings but the app is definitely slower now. Looking forward to a new and interesting project. Will find one tomorrow.

* Day 10
  > Thought and then dropped several ideas for projects. I began a codelab on Material 2.0 for the Web (Web always). After finishing that, i'll begin working on android for little bit (and Web on the side of course). Today i learned that git can manage multiple accounts. Setting it up is easy but i worry, one step and all configs and changed. Lost one repo in such a case. Well, today there was no commit, only offline working. Maybe tomorrow there will be.

* Day 11
  > Completed the codelab. Last one included integration of Material Components into JS frameworks, and i have to say, i missed the vanilla js very much. It is much more simple. Its not that frameworks aren't better, they are but its a lot of logic in JS just to get the visual right, and being a designer first person, i have to say its not very good. I hope i get a chance to use material in one of my projects in the near future. There is one little project next, and then i'm thinking of focusing on *Design* or *React* for a while. Also, not commits today, only offline code. 90 days to go, still strong.

* Day 12
  > Almost missed a day. Today i read and tried a little flutter. One takeaway, it is only good if you are doing it with an IDE telling you what you mean. Otherwise it takes a whole lot of time remembering what every widget is. Maybe thats a downside only for me, maybe not. Other than that, i have begun the work on making the texttoemoji a pwa and improve its design. Will continue tomorrow.

* Day 13
  > Almost completed making my pwa if it wasn't for a stubborn error. Spent half of the day trying to fix it, but its not at all easy. One thing i came to know, it is necessary to clean up chrome saved data once in a while. Apparently my chrome mobile says it can't save 400kb of data because there is no space. Hope i resolve it before i snap the phone in two.
  
* Day 14
  > Spent almost all of the day reading and learning about PWAs. Couldn't figure out why my chrome was giving me low storage error. Also i couldn't figure why i wasn't getting the option to add to home. Turns out if you either select yes or no to the said option, you will not see that option again for nearly 2 months. Only now i knew it was working alright before my tweakings all day. So the PWA is [here](https://kayd33.github.io/TextToEmoji). No commits today, only offline work. Hope to start something new tomorrow.

* Day 15
  > Spent the day reading about UX from random google articles. A lot of stuff was just repeating but the new stuff was pretty amazing, especially the psycological effects of color and motion. Created some pens copying those things in CSS. So, light coding only, but equally important.

* Day 16
  > Watched some videos on design and did a little research on apps design on mobile. Also, began working along with a video on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE7Vtzq52xg). Hope it does take me a lot of time with this, because i got time. Then up next, i have a React project.
  
* Day 17
  > Followed with the video and made the repo [here](https://github.com/kayd33/vigilant-sniffle). I think flutter can be a good thing for a person really wanting to go mainstream on it, but for someone learning it just for knowledge, it can be tiring. So my advice, leave at the basics. Also looked for some react ideas, when i remembered a previous idea of an analog clock. I know: simple and yet still i want to do it. And i will. Hope it turns out good.

* Day 18
  > Did a little react today. One thing that was adamant today was that CSS can be forgotten, as opposed to my previous view that i wouldn't. Today, i made an analog clock. Its not a big project, but sometimes you have to lay back before going forward. The deployed version is [here](https://kayd33.github.io/JustAClock). The UI is not what i thought, but it is what i could execute.

* Day 19
  > Started my learning on the Web apps. Today's lesson was [Accessibility](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/). Some of the things i learnt was the use of taborder and making for the screenreaders. Its a challenging task because during the flow of work, i tend to forget the little things. Also, restarting node.js for a project. So no commits for a while, till i decide to make an app.

* Day 20
  > Continued studying accessibility. Today learning from a course (link soon),so no commits. Only reading. Yes the rules allow that.
