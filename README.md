# 100DaysOfCode

This is my second attempt at this challenge. Last time, i did not know the "documentation" rule.

* Day 1

  > Started with **React** apps making process. Made a very basic Todo app [here](https://github.com/kayd33/Todo/tree/master/todo-1)
  
* Day 2
  > Started learning about Polymer from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaWcS-10NIw&list=PLLnpHn493BHHbOWwQxtGCVfEgWZxxofyA) and the official [page](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/start/)

* Day 3
  > Continued with reading on polymer. Today i tried a hands-on practice rather than just reading. I tried making a couple of simple elements, fixed some problems with importing elements. Hopefully there will be something worth posting on github as well.

* Day 4
  > Began making a polymer carousel element by following and understanding the codelab. I'm following the polymer 2 codelab in  Poylmer 3. It took the whole day and now i'm stuck at the second last step. I even opened an issue and i'll try to fix it myself tomorrow.

* Day 5
  > Opened an issue and got the solution for the error. Not the element works. Meanwhile i began learning about PWAs. I'm thinking of starting a Udemy course on that. Will provide more info on that in later days. Now i added touch events as the final step of codelab. Will test it on an actual mobile tomorrow.

  > UPDATE: Tested in the mobile simulator of Chrome. It works just fine.

* Day 6
  > Began developing a new js app. Will make a repo soon (most probably tomorrow). Also, finished the *getting to know the course* section of the PWA course. Didn't get time to do more. Also, i had to learn the basics of webpack to get the app running. One more thing, Polymer 3 community is so not good at this time. There is nothing else except the official docs for help. Hope that changes soon.
