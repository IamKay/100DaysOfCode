# 100DaysOfCode

This is my second attempt at this challenge. Last time, i did not know the "documentation" rule.

* Day 1

  > Started with **React** apps making process. Made a very basic Todo app [here](https://github.com/kayd33/Todo/tree/master/todo-1)
  
* Day 2
  > Started learning about Polymer from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaWcS-10NIw&list=PLLnpHn493BHHbOWwQxtGCVfEgWZxxofyA) and the official [page](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/start/)
