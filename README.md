# 100DaysOfCode

This is my second attempt at this challenge. Last time, i did not know the "documentation" rule, so it didn't count.

* Day 1

  > Started with **React** apps making process. Made a very basic Todo app [here](https://github.com/kayd33/Todo/tree/master/todo-1)
  
* Day 2
  > Started learning about Polymer from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaWcS-10NIw&list=PLLnpHn493BHHbOWwQxtGCVfEgWZxxofyA) and the official [page](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/start/)

* Day 3
  > Continued with reading on polymer. Today i tried a hands-on practice rather than just reading. I tried making a couple of simple elements, fixed some problems with importing elements. Hopefully there will be something worth posting on github as well.

* Day 4
  > Began making a polymer carousel element by following and understanding the codelab. I'm following the polymer 2 codelab in  Poylmer 3. It took the whole day and now i'm stuck at the second last step. I even opened an issue and i'll try to fix it myself tomorrow.

* Day 5
  > Opened an issue and got the solution for the error. Not the element works. Meanwhile i began learning about PWAs. I'm thinking of starting a Udemy course on that. Will provide more info on that in later days. Now i added touch events as the final step of codelab. Will test it on an actual mobile tomorrow.

  > UPDATE: Tested in the mobile simulator of Chrome. It works just fine.

* Day 6
  > Began developing a new js app. Will make a repo soon (most probably tomorrow). Also, finished the *getting to know the course* section of the PWA course. Didn't get time to do more. Also, i had to learn the basics of webpack to get the app running. One more thing, Polymer 3 community is so not good at this time. There is nothing else except the official docs for help. Hope that changes soon.

* Day 7
  > Made the repo [here](https://github.com/kayd33/TextToEmoji). Still working on it. The processing is a bit tricky because the number of combinations to consider is high. Hoperfully till mid next week i'll work it out completely. 

* Day 8
  > Worked out the logic sooner than i thought. It is now working, pushed a styles commit too. It looks a acceptable now. I do have a few things left in this app. Will do that tommorow.

* Day 9
  > Completed the app. The working app is [here](https://kayd33.github.io/TextToEmoji). Working out the last bit was not easy. I was dealing with MDL library and had to make it shorter. Didn't really compare the timings but the app is definitely slower now. Looking forward to a new and interesting project. Will find one tomorrow.

* Day 10
  > Thought and then dropped several ideas for projects. I began a codelab on Material 2.0 for the Web (Web always). After finishing that, i'll begin working on android for little bit (and Web on the side of course). Today i learned that git can manage multiple accounts. Setting it up is easy but i worry, one step and all configs and changed. Lost one repo in such a case. Well, today there was no commit, only offline working. Maybe tomorrow there will be.

* Day 11
  > Completed the codelab. Last one included integration of Material Components into JS frameworks, and i have to say, i missed the vanilla js very much. It is much more simple. Its not that frameworks aren't better, they are but its a lot of logic in JS just to get the visual right, and being a designer first person, i have to say its not very good. I hope i get a chance to use material in one of my projects in the near future. There is one little project next, and then i'm thinking of focusing on *Design* or *React* for a while. Also, not commits today, only offline code. 90 days to go, still strong.

* Day 12
  > Almost missed a day. Today i read and tried a little flutter. One takeaway, it is only good if you are doing it with an IDE telling you what you mean. Otherwise it takes a whole lot of time remembering what every widget is. Maybe thats a downside only for me, maybe not. Other than that, i have begun the work on making the texttoemoji a pwa and improve its design. Will continue tomorrow.

* Day 13
  > Almost completed making my pwa if it wasn't for a stubborn error. Spent half of the day trying to fix it, but its not at all easy. One thing i came to know, it is necessary to clean up chrome saved data once in a while. Apparently my chrome mobile says it can't save 400kb of data because there is no space. Hope i resolve it before i snap the phone in two.
  
* Day 14
  > Spent almost all of the day reading and learning about PWAs. Couldn't figure out why my chrome was giving me low storage error. Also i couldn't figure why i wasn't getting the option to add to home. Turns out if you either select yes or no to the said option, you will not see that option again for nearly 2 months. Only now i knew it was working alright before my tweakings all day. So the PWA is [here](https://kayd33.github.io/TextToEmoji). No commits today, only offline work. Hope to start something new tomorrow.

* Day 15
  > Spent the day reading about UX from random google articles. A lot of stuff was just repeating but the new stuff was pretty amazing, especially the psycological effects of color and motion. Created some pens copying those things in CSS. So, light coding only, but equally important.

* Day 16
  > Watched some videos on design and did a little research on apps design on mobile. Also, began working along with a video on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE7Vtzq52xg). Hope it does take me a lot of time with this, because i got time. Then up next, i have a React project.
  
* Day 17
  > Followed with the video and made the repo [here](https://github.com/kayd33/vigilant-sniffle). I think flutter can be a good thing for a person really wanting to go mainstream on it, but for someone learning it just for knowledge, it can be tiring. So my advice, leave at the basics. Also looked for some react ideas, when i remembered a previous idea of an analog clock. I know: simple and yet still i want to do it. And i will. Hope it turns out good.

* Day 18
  > Did a little react today. One thing that was adamant today was that CSS can be forgotten, as opposed to my previous view that i wouldn't. Today, i made an analog clock. Its not a big project, but sometimes you have to lay back before going forward. The deployed version is [here](https://kayd33.github.io/JustAClock). The UI is not what i thought, but it is what i could execute.

* Day 19
  > Started my learning on the Web apps. Today's lesson was [Accessibility](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/). Some of the things i learnt was the use of taborder and making for the screenreaders. Its a challenging task because during the flow of work, i tend to forget the little things. Also, restarting node.js for a project. So no commits for a while, till i decide to make an app.

* Day 20
  > Continued studying accessibility. Today learning from a course (link soon),so no commits. Only reading. Yes the rules allow that.

* Day 21
  > Completed 3 sections of the course. Today was optimisation. Learning to make better sites. **#NotOnlyNiceLooking**
  80 days to go. Still strong.

* Day 22 
   > Still going on with the course. Finished another section. Had a little file to make today. Took most of the day figuring out the nuances of CSS. Newer errors are emerging now. The latest one is *text node whitespace*. Hoping for the course to get over tomorrow.

* Day 23
  > Couldn't do a lot today. I was travelling. Although i managed to do a little reading on some articles and helped a friend with a problem. It wasn't easy because it wasn't what i usually do, Python. So, hoping tomorrow will be better.

* Day 24
  > Completed the course finally. It was basically theory thats why i completed it fast. Then read about PWAs, some numbers and stats of what makes them special. Hope to start making some with the newfound knowledge soon.
 
* Day 25
  > Did a little reading on best practices of PWA and i have a lot of learning to do in that area. Then i worked half the day trying to set up django with postgresql. I have to tell you its not an easy thing to do on a mac. I did become annoyed but i need that combination for my work.

* Day 26
  > Continued reading PWA. Today was fetch. Also, finished configuring the postgresql (with a lot of help). I do have some obstacles in the way before i can fully dedicate to web dev. Hope that i grow used to them soon because it is affecting my progress.

* Day 27
  > Today was basically thinking day. Thinking about the future learning and building. I am currently on pwa but that limits my reach to my other desires. But when i try to pursue those, web calls me back. A dilemma. Also i did code a little, as help for a friend. The guy is doing a tough project, making an enterprise grade backend system for a company he wishes to be in. Can't say the specifics. That's it for today.

* Day 28
  > Learnt about flutter a little. As for web, i started with the basics of IndexedDB along with a codelab as well. Long day today, not a practical work.

* Day 29
  > Learnt a lot about my progress in JS. I have a long way to go. I am currently fixing some issues in a product in JS. It is a simple task of making a function but the thought of DRY makes it time consuming. Advice: Don't always go for the fancy ways that people are using. If it can work, use the simple ones.

* Day 30
  > Did a little JS, watched some videos. Nothing fancy, just vanilla. Posted it here as well. Don't really have an idea for a big project or a small one for that matter. I am searching but in the meanwhile, small pens i like.

* Day 31
  > Spent the day watching JS vids and nothing else. The code written today was PHP (i know pfff). It was as a help for someone. Just keeping the "code everyday" tradition alive. No links to share as of now. Maybe soon. 70 days to go. Still strong.

* Day 32
  > Today PHP took most of the time. Rest (whatever of it) was spent watching JS vids. There are a lot of good creators on Youtube for that. So, same thing for a number of days. And probably for some more days as well.

* Day 33
  > More JS vids. This time i aimes for the more complex topics like async. There is a great video that i liked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrNQS8J67zc). I found Shelley Vohr to be very cute (i know, obvious). She looks my age and she is working at Github. Wish i knew the secret. Did some offline work too. Its a private repo so cant post a link.

* Day 34
  > Couple of JS videos today. Tried to follow along in practical but failed. Also, little bit of frontend. Didn't know i could get stuck at frontend too of all things. Couldn't do a lot, had some other stuff to do. Same for tomorrow as well.

* Day 35
  > Didn't get a lot of time today. Today(yesterday) was a very important day. It has nothing to do with code so not posting any details. Just mental images with me. Also, i managed to watch half of a Coding Tech vid and search for some react projects or PWAs. I think i have some in mind. Will see to it tomorrow.

* Day 36
  > It was sunday so i took rest. But i didn't fail the challenge, did a little frontend today. Not that valuable stuff.

* Day 37
  > Spent half the day resting and other half thinking of what to make next. So, started making a pokedex with React. Not that complex one, the easy one from an articl. Will push here too, in a while.

* Day 38
  > Completed the Pokedex. For someone wanting to know what it is, here is a cool implementation of it [https://www.pokedex.org/](https://www.pokedex.org/). I made a simpler one, very simpler one from this [article](https://blog.cloudboost.io/lets-build-a-pokedex-with-react-part-1-e1ba0b9387a7). Got into a little problem with fetch, which i didn't think i would (cuz i studied it before). Turns out, i forgot the basics. No i'm thinking of making something cool. It would take a lot of searching.

* Day 39
  > Watched some JS today. It was about some algorithms. Will try implement those tomorrow. Not much was done today except a little basic code.

* Day 40
  > Didn't do a lot, just some basic videos. Learnt about the basics of [Tensorflow.js](js.tensorflow.org) (tensors, variables, functions, memory management). Its a good thing but something i would not suggest as a beginner though. Also, i'm kinda documenting yesterday so don't really remember what i did.

* Day 41
  > Was at an event of Actions on Google. Learnt a lot from it, and will build something in it. There was definitely code in it. 60 days to go. Not that strong now.

* Day 42
  > Today was frontend day. Spent half the day doing HTML and CSS. Nothing worth showing though. Can't get time for something big. Maybe tomorrow. Also, i think i am messing up the time that i write this. I will try to maintain it.

* Day 43
  > Today, i didn't waste my time (only half a day. Progress!). So today i was working on actions for assistant. I made a prototype. The correct one will function if i get a suitable API. I have to say i need to get ideas on handling entities dynamically and efficiently (wow, big words!). So, hope that i find the API or the data soon. Until then, the action is complete.

* Day 44
  > Did a little research as to what new features to add to the action(it seemed a little dull). Found some features but it would be redundant to implement them as i dont have an API(i would hav to change the implementation when i get the API). Also, currently doing a little frontend for a friend. Its with a little PHP too. Kind of in a pickle here. I can't figure out how to use CSS to push down content when introducing an already present element. Stackoverflow says its impossible. Not me.

* Day 45
  > Still doing frontend. Today i bought a home mini so half a day went there. Other than that i was making the homepage for a site that i am working on. Nothing difficult, just cool HTML, CSS.

* Dy 46
  > Nothing new. Same as day 45.

* Day 47
  > Finally finished the work. It was really a front end pickle and kinda led me to the edge. Hope that i keep facing the edges. So, probably something new tomorrow.

* Day 48
  > So, i tried circle packing in JS today. Turns out JS canvas is still not that mature. There aren't methods to read an image without a canvas. Its not easy for me to accept defeat for JS. I will try another approach, but not in the near future.I will push something or other here in this week though.

* Day 49
  > Came across something called Fractals today. Also made my first fractal called the *Barnsley Fern* in JS. Pushed to github [here](https://github.com/kayd33/Some-Pens/tree/master/Fern). Link to the video of [Dan](https://github.com/kayd33/Some-Pens/tree/master/Fern). Some other fractal next.

* Day 50
  > Watched videos of making fractals on Dan's channel (link above) and thought "basic is easy". So i kept watching but didn't make any today.

* Day 51
  > Did frontend JS today. Nothing major. Also, started watching a Neural net trilogy on (FunFunFunction)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98qlvrcqiU]. Not going to follow, just listen. I love MPJ but in this one, he seems a bit rude for the ML people. Could be just my views. I still liked the videos. (watched 2 of them). 50 days to go, im ok.

* Day 52
  > Completed the FFF neural net videos. Learned about the basics from the Andrew Ng course of ML (Machine Learning). Hope that i continue on it. Also, did a little frontend JS. I am getting more and more distracted now a days. Its one of those that just won't go away that easily.

* Day 53
  > Things didn't go as planned and i only managed to frontend today. Not able to make time for the big stuff.

* Day 54
  > Finally a change. Today i made a number sequence visualisation in JS from Dan's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhFZfzOvNTU). It looks ok, but i think i made it very browser heavy. You can check [it](https://codepen.io/KayD33/full/LBOLVY/) if you want. Also, couple of lectures from a ML course on [NPTEL](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in). All in all

* Day 55
  > So half of today was a spent in searching for a project that i make next. Also, next half was spent reading and trying to understand **Go** code. I do have the project in mind, but cant share yet. It is big for me, that i can tell. It might take a while to make it, so will start from tomorrow. (Also, when i say half the day, it doesn't mean 12hrs but much less)

* Day 56
  > So i spent the day making some trials for the project that i want to build. Turns out that it is more difficult than i previously thought. So, for the next 10 days or so, i don't think there will be more something other than this.

* Day 57
  > Same log as yesterday just a lot less in time. I got sick so couldn't manage to do a lot.

* Day 58
  > Couldn't do anything today, barely can even write this log.

* Day 59
  > Tried what i could in my condition. Tried to understand how i would go about making the project. The test/trials that i made didn't work so i'm still at square one unfortunately. Hope to see some progress when i'm better.

* Day 60
  > Spent the day looking at code and trying to understand it. Its the kind of code i dream of writing but can't understand even a function of it. Beginning to think i bit more than i can chew.

* Day 61
  > Didn't get a lot of time but whatever time i got, i tried understanding the code, and i'm finally making a lil progress. So i will begin the **copying** process from tomorrow. 40 days to go, i'm lil better

* Day 62
  > Had college today, so didn't get that much time. Whatever i got, spent the day reading the damn code.

* Day 63
  > Same story as yesterday except that i did a lil hackerrank today. Few questions away from getting a gold badge.

* Day 64
  > Returned home tired and forgot about the project. So ended up doing 3 or 4 hackerranks (easy ones) and finally got a gold badge. Also, my first time implementing linked lists in JS. So much better than C.

* Day 65
  > Just can't seem to get time for the project. Something interferes everytime. Today were physical conditions, tomorrrow it will be another task. I hope i can start that soon. BTW, did some hackerrrank, trying to increase the ranking.

* Day 66
  > Did a lil frontend today (some funky html elements). Still not getting the time (*or the will*) to start the project. Thats all for.

* Day 67
  > Holiday today and so i had more time than usual. Did frontend today, that took a lot of time. Other than that, i searched for other technologies and kept looking. Just for knowledge, not changing that fast. Also, didn't do any hackerrank either.

* Day 68
  > Sunday was rest day. However i did a little html, and listened to some podcasts. So that counts as code too and i'm still in the challenge.

* Day 69
  > Completed my daily quota of html. Big news is that finally i'm starting the project now. I have an hour and a half for today's time. So good luck to me.

* Day 70
  > Couldn't do project today (tired) so began listening to [Talk Python to me](https://talkpython.fm/). Listened two episodes today.

* Day 71
  > Worked on the project today and realised that if you are working on JS, you have to know about promises. In detail. Not just the theory but the ways in which they can be used, apparently there are many. 30 days to go, regaining the strength.

* Day 72
  > Did some tough frontend stuff. Tough for me only. Couldn't figure out the javascript logic for it. Finally i did. Also, very lil work is done on the project. Hope to do more tomorrow.

* Day 73
  > Learnt Wordpress today. Friend had a doubt so i had to learn it first (i was postponing wordpress for a while, so win win). So now i know the basics and i'm glad i didn't learn it before. Now beginning the work on the project too.

* Day 74
  > Did some video watching for some JS logic i need for making a image slider (not really a simple one) for a friend. It includes touch and gesture support as well so got to carry extra weight of jQuery-UI. Sad. Other than that, didn;t write any meaningful code.

* Day 75
  > Managed to do a lil bit of frontend. Also, have to make a couple of widgets in react for someone, so i'll begin those tomorrow.

* Day 76
  > Started doing the react stuff i was talking about. I'll post a link to the repo(s) soon. Also, installing preact is difficult. So a fix is to use **yarn**. Even then a couple of dependencies are left. So either configure the project by hand or just use **create-react-app**.

* Day 77
  > Managed to do a lil hackerrank. It was for a competition, and i couldn;t even solve one q. Sad. Also, resumed a bit on the project. Hope to see it complete soon (I don't think it will be though)

* Day 78
  > Chilled half the day. Rest half was spent on hackerrank and worrying about why i can't solve on hackerrank. Now working on the project (i don't know why i'm not interested in doing it more often)

* Day 79
  > Did some project work today. Progress is good, however i have to say that i don't really understand some / many of the logics so i'm just blindly copying. First time i did that, not proud of it.

* Day 80
  > Couldn't manage to do any serious work but i did spend an hour trying to understand a piece of code for my project. Man, you really get to know about the number of pixels when you are working on every single one of them

* Day 81
  > Spent about 16 hours in front of my laptop. 10 were about the project, maybe a couple for studying for exams and the rest i don't know. So, the test version is running, that too very sloppy. I intent to build on it and make it better. But that will happen after my exams. So the plan is to just watch code videos while the exams and share the links. Can't really code in the meantime. 20 days to go, meh.

* Day 82
  > As i said, i could only watch videos. So here is today's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSn-DJU8qf0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSn-DJU8qf0). Didn't even watch it full.

* Day 83
  > Spent a lot of hours just trying to figure out the logic for a pen. I couldn't fyi. I was hoping to make it in pure canvas, but looks like that is not going to happen. I'll try some other way (not canvas) and upload it when it is completed. As for the video, here is today's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67k3I2GxTH8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67k3I2GxTH8).

* Day 84
  > Didn't do a lot except thinking on that logic. Also, today's video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-PZ78KDeag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-PZ78KDeag)

* Day 85
  > Worked on the pen i mentioned earlier. It involves playing with coordinate geometry and thats why its taking a lot of time. Its maybe 10% completed. Also, no video today.

* Day 86
  > Worked (cracked my brain to be specific) on the pen. The only thing keeping it from its next stage is that an element cannot be shrunk beyond 0% in CSS. Spent half the day on it. 6-7 hrs.

* Day 87
  > Worked on the project (main one) and finally got it to work. It is pushed [here](https://github.com/IamKay/Geometrize).

* Day 88
  > Added a little bit of my on fixes in the project. All that remains now is the styling (if i choose). I'll do that tomorrow. Other than that, didn't get much time today to do anything else. Oh, today's video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKYlikFAV4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKYlikFAV4k)

* Day 89
  > Didn't work on project. Instead, i fixed half the links in my projects on GH. It took longer than i thought. After that, i tried and solved 2 hackerrank problems (although beginner level).

* Day 90
  > Made *very* minor changes in the project. Spent the day searching for scholarships by google. I found a couple in Udacity but i missed the deadline by 7 months. Sad. Also, i would like to make an official claim that *I will get a google certification before completing college*. Its a thing i get excited about it and forget after a while. So, little work today.

* Day 91
  > Finished 2 modules of the Google's [machine learning course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/). By *finished* i mean read. I understood only a little of it. 10 days to go. Finally towards the end

* Day 92
  > Did two more modules of the course. Didn't get time for anything more.

* Day 93
  > Completed two more modules of the course. It was easy in the beginning but there are more and more unfamiliar concepts like *Binning*, *Feature crossing*, *One hot encoding*. I am writing this 2 hours early (not that its important) because i might have to go sleep in a hurry and i may not have the time for this.

* Day 94
  > Completed one more module and left one (too difficult for me, will do later). Now it will be on hold because i got another course to do. Its mainly a frontend course and is supposed to be good. Will share the link soon. Also, i *think* i will make  repo of what i make during the course.

* Day 95
  > No ML today. Finished a beginners course on Angular. It was a short one (1 or 1.5 hrs total). The link is [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/ng-big-picture). Now I'm beginning another one (link soon). I just hope i don't get lost in tutorial madness.

* Day 96
  > Continued with the course. Completed 2 modules today. About 3 hrs of content still remains. Also, made a repo for the things i will make during the course. Repo [here](https://github.com/kaydee/Pluralsight)

* Day 97
  > Finished two more modules in the Pluralsight course (Progress is being uploaded side by side). I don't know the number but there are many left. Also, i'll finish two modules of the MLCC course before sleeping. Sometimes i think i am taking a lil too much load for my own good. [Update: finished one (out of the said two) module of MLCC] It was about crossing different features to make increase the efficiency that we get from linear models.

* Day 98
  > Finished another module of MLCC. It was about *L2 regualarisation* which is used to ensure that the model doesn't overfit or underfit with training data and testing data. Could only manage to do this much, i was feeling a lil sleepy today.

* Day 99
  > Did one more module of MLCC. Attempted to complete another one but failed. It wasn't even half completed. And yes i know the Pluralsight course is pending and i will get to it as soon as i can (maybe tomorrow).

* Day 100
  > Did one more module of MLCC. It was about *Logistic Reasoning*. The gist is that we pass our regular predictions (that we got from the model) through a sigmoid function (Sigmoid changes the value(s) to fit in the 0-1 range(inclusive).) and the resulting value is the probability that we can use to classify the result into categories. (Eg. Spam or not spam)
