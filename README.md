# 100DaysOfCode

This is my second attempt at this challenge. Last time, i did not know the "documentation" rule, so it didn't count.

* Day 1

  > Started with **React** apps making process. Made a very basic Todo app [here](https://github.com/kayd33/Todo/tree/master/todo-1)
  
* Day 2
  > Started learning about Polymer from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaWcS-10NIw&list=PLLnpHn493BHHbOWwQxtGCVfEgWZxxofyA) and the official [page](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/start/)

* Day 3
  > Continued with reading on polymer. Today i tried a hands-on practice rather than just reading. I tried making a couple of simple elements, fixed some problems with importing elements. Hopefully there will be something worth posting on github as well.

* Day 4
  > Began making a polymer carousel element by following and understanding the codelab. I'm following the polymer 2 codelab in  Poylmer 3. It took the whole day and now i'm stuck at the second last step. I even opened an issue and i'll try to fix it myself tomorrow.

* Day 5
  > Opened an issue and got the solution for the error. Not the element works. Meanwhile i began learning about PWAs. I'm thinking of starting a Udemy course on that. Will provide more info on that in later days. Now i added touch events as the final step of codelab. Will test it on an actual mobile tomorrow.

  > UPDATE: Tested in the mobile simulator of Chrome. It works just fine.

* Day 6
  > Began developing a new js app. Will make a repo soon (most probably tomorrow). Also, finished the *getting to know the course* section of the PWA course. Didn't get time to do more. Also, i had to learn the basics of webpack to get the app running. One more thing, Polymer 3 community is so not good at this time. There is nothing else except the official docs for help. Hope that changes soon.

* Day 7
  > Made the repo [here](https://github.com/kayd33/TextToEmoji). Still working on it. The processing is a bit tricky because the number of combinations to consider is high. Hoperfully till mid next week i'll work it out completely. 

* Day 8
  > Worked out the logic sooner than i thought. It is now working, pushed a styles commit too. It looks a acceptable now. I do have a few things left in this app. Will do that tommorow.

* Day 9
  > Completed the app. The working app is [here](https://kayd33.github.io/TextToEmoji). Working out the last bit was not easy. I was dealing with MDL library and had to make it shorter. Didn't really compare the timings but the app is definitely slower now. Looking forward to a new and interesting project. Will find one tomorrow.

* Day 10
  > Thought and then dropped several ideas for projects. I began a codelab on Material 2.0 for the Web (Web always). After finishing that, i'll begin working on android for little bit (and Web on the side of course). Today i learned that git can manage multiple accounts. Setting it up is easy but i worry, one step and all configs and changed. Lost one repo in such a case. Well, today there was no commit, only offline working. Maybe tomorrow there will be.

* Day 11
  > Completed the codelab. Last one included integration of Material Components into JS frameworks, and i have to say, i missed the vanilla js very much. It is much more simple. Its not that frameworks aren't better, they are but its a lot of logic in JS just to get the visual right, and being a designer first person, i have to say its not very good. I hope i get a chance to use material in one of my projects in the near future. There is one little project next, and then i'm thinking of focusing on *Design* or *React* for a while. Also, not commits today, only offline code. 90 days to go, still strong.

* Day 12
  > Almost missed a day. Today i read and tried a little flutter. One takeaway, it is only good if you are doing it with an IDE telling you what you mean. Otherwise it takes a whole lot of time remembering what every widget is. Maybe thats a downside only for me, maybe not. Other than that, i have begun the work on making the texttoemoji a pwa and improve its design. Will continue tomorrow.

* Day 13
  > Almost completed making my pwa if it wasn't for a stubborn error. Spent half of the day trying to fix it, but its not at all easy. One thing i came to know, it is necessary to clean up chrome saved data once in a while. Apparently my chrome mobile says it can't save 400kb of data because there is no space. Hope i resolve it before i snap the phone in two.
  
* Day 14
  > Spent almost all of the day reading and learning about PWAs. Couldn't figure out why my chrome was giving me low storage error. Also i couldn't figure why i wasn't getting the option to add to home. Turns out if you either select yes or no to the said option, you will not see that option again for nearly 2 months. Only now i knew it was working alright before my tweakings all day. So the PWA is [here](https://kayd33.github.io/TextToEmoji). No commits today, only offline work. Hope to start something new tomorrow.

* Day 15
  > Spent the day reading about UX from random google articles. A lot of stuff was just repeating but the new stuff was pretty amazing, especially the psycological effects of color and motion. Created some pens copying those things in CSS. So, light coding only, but equally important.

* Day 16
  > Watched some videos on design and did a little research on apps design on mobile. Also, began working along with a video on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE7Vtzq52xg). Hope it does take me a lot of time with this, because i got time. Then up next, i have a React project.
  
* Day 17
  > Followed with the video and made the repo [here](https://github.com/kayd33/vigilant-sniffle). I think flutter can be a good thing for a person really wanting to go mainstream on it, but for someone learning it just for knowledge, it can be tiring. So my advice, leave at the basics. Also looked for some react ideas, when i remembered a previous idea of an analog clock. I know: simple and yet still i want to do it. And i will. Hope it turns out good.

* Day 18
  > Did a little react today. One thing that was adamant today was that CSS can be forgotten, as opposed to my previous view that i wouldn't. Today, i made an analog clock. Its not a big project, but sometimes you have to lay back before going forward. The deployed version is [here](https://kayd33.github.io/JustAClock). The UI is not what i thought, but it is what i could execute.

* Day 19
  > Started my learning on the Web apps. Today's lesson was [Accessibility](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/). Some of the things i learnt was the use of taborder and making for the screenreaders. Its a challenging task because during the flow of work, i tend to forget the little things. Also, restarting node.js for a project. So no commits for a while, till i decide to make an app.

* Day 20
  > Continued studying accessibility. Today learning from a course (link soon),so no commits. Only reading. Yes the rules allow that.

* Day 21
  > Completed 3 sections of the course. Today was optimisation. Learning to make better sites. **#NotOnlyNiceLooking**
  80 days to go. Still strong.

* Day 22 
   > Still going on with the course. Finished another section. Had a little file to make today. Took most of the day figuring out the nuances of CSS. Newer errors are emerging now. The latest one is *text node whitespace*. Hoping for the course to get over tomorrow.

* Day 23
  > Couldn't do a lot today. I was travelling. Although i managed to do a little reading on some articles and helped a friend with a problem. It wasn't easy because it wasn't what i usually do, Python. So, hoping tomorrow will be better.

* Day 24
  > Completed the course finally. It was basically theory thats why i completed it fast. Then read about PWAs, some numbers and stats of what makes them special. Hope to start making some with the newfound knowledge soon.
 
* Day 25
  > Did a little reading on best practices of PWA and i have a lot of learning to do in that area. Then i worked half the day trying to set up django with postgresql. I have to tell you its not an easy thing to do on a mac. I did become annoyed but i need that combination for my work.

* Day 26
  > Continued reading PWA. Today was fetch. Also, finished configuring the postgresql (with a lot of help). I do have some obstacles in the way before i can fully dedicate to web dev. Hope that i grow used to them soon because it is affecting my progress.

* Day 27
  > Today was basically thinking day. Thinking about the future learning and building. I am currently on pwa but that limits my reach to my other desires. But when i try to pursue those, web calls me back. A dilemma. Also i did code a little, as help for a friend. The guy is doing a tough project, making an enterprise grade backend system for a company he wishes to be in. Can't say the specifics. That's it for today.

* Day 28
  > Learnt about flutter a little. As for web, i started with the basics of IndexedDB along with a codelab as well. Long day today, not a practical work.

* Day 29
  > Learnt a lot about my progress in JS. I have a long way to go. I am currently fixing some issues in a product in JS. It is a simple task of making a function but the thought of DRY makes it time consuming. Advice: Don't always go for the fancy ways that people are using. If it can work, use the simple ones.

* Day 30
  > Did a little JS, watched some videos. Nothing fancy, just vanilla. Posted it here as well. Don't really have an idea for a big project or a small one for that matter. I am searching but in the meanwhile, small pens i like.

* Day 31
  > Spent the day watching JS vids and nothing else. The code written today was PHP (i know pfff). It was as a help for someone. Just keeping the "code everyday" tradition alive. No links to share as of now. Maybe soon. 70 days to go. Still strong.

* Day 32
  > Today PHP took most of the time. Rest (whatever of it) was spent watching JS vids. There are a lot of good creators on Youtube for that. So, same thing for a number of days. And probably for some more days as well.

* Day 33
  > More JS vids. This time i aimes for the more complex topics like async. There is a great video that i liked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrNQS8J67zc). I found Shelley Vohr to be very cute (i know, obvious). She looks my age and she is working at Github. Wish i knew the secret. Did some offline work too. Its a private repo so cant post a link.

* Day 34
  > Couple of JS videos today. Tried to follow along in practical but failed. Also, little bit of frontend. Didn't know i could get stuck at frontend too of all things. Couldn't do a lot, had some other stuff to do. Same for tomorrow as well.

* Day 35
  > Didn't get a lot of time today. Today(yesterday) was a very important day. It has nothing to do with code so not posting any details. Just mental images with me. Also, i managed to watch half of a Coding Tech vid and search for some react projects or PWAs. I think i have some in mind. Will see to it tomorrow.

* Day 36
  > It was sunday so i took rest. But i didn't fail the challenge, did a little frontend today. Not that valuable stuff.

* Day 37
  > Spent half the day resting and other half thinking of what to make next. So, started making a pokedex with React. Not that complex one, the easy one from an articl. Will push here too, in a while.

* Day 38
  > Completed the Pokedex. For someone wanting to know what it is, here is a cool implementation of it [https://www.pokedex.org/](https://www.pokedex.org/). I made a simpler one, very simpler one from this [article](https://blog.cloudboost.io/lets-build-a-pokedex-with-react-part-1-e1ba0b9387a7). Got into a little problem with fetch, which i didn't think i would (cuz i studied it before). Turns out, i forgot the basics. No i'm thinking of making something cool. It would take a lot of searching.

* Day 39
  > Watched some JS today. It was about some algorithms. Will try implement those tomorrow. Not much was done today except a little basic code.

* Day 40
  > Didn't do a lot, just some basic videos. Learnt about the basics of [Tensorflow.js](js.tensorflow.org) (tensors, variables, functions, memory management). Its a good thing but something i would not suggest as a beginner though. Also, i'm kinda documenting yesterday so don't really remember what i did.

* Day 41
  > Was at an event of Actions on Google. Learnt a lot from it, and will build something in it. There was definitely code in it. 60 days to go. Not that strong now.

* Day 42
  > Today was frontend day. Spent half the day doing HTML and CSS. Nothing worth showing though. Can't get time for something big.
